The framework also includes alternative technology platforms for managing the customers' recruitment processes.

ESPO will impose on economic operators requirements aimed at protecting the confidential nature of information made available throughout the procurement procedure (as permitted by Regulation 21(3)) and, before receiving that information, economic operators will be required to complete & return a Confidentiality Agreement, which will be available once economic operators have expressed an interest in the tender opportunity.

Lot 1: Managed Service Provision - Service provision where one Managed Service Provider takes responsibility for delivering recruitment services on behalf of the Customer, as an alternative to the Customer managing a framework of individual Agencies. Managed Services can often involve the Managed Service Provider operating a 'tiered' structure of Agencies to deliver the Services, dependent on the service model provided.

Lot 2: Vendor Management System - For Customers who are looking for a technology solution to help them manage recruitment Agencies, either on a self-service basis where recruitment is devolved to Hiring Managers, or via their own internal recruitment team. The system used will help Customers to manage their supply chain, and interact with Agencies & Temporary Agency Workers through the system in regards to ordering, timesheet reconciliation, compliance & management information

Lot 3: Talent Pool Technology - For Customers who are looking for a Talent Pool Technology Platform that they can contract with directly and either include within their existing MSP delivery model or develop as a stand-alone solution. A Talent Pool Technology Platform is an online database which allows a Worker to register, create, maintain & delete their own profile and be matched automatically to jobs put forward through the platform by Hiring Managers. The Talent Pool Technology Platform will be available via desktop and/or app. As such, Tenders will only be accepted for Lot 3 from Tenderers who fulfil the Talent Pool Technology Core Specification. Tenderers for Lot 3 Talent Pool Technology will own the intellectual property rights (IPR) and development of the platform.

The framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months. The total estimated value stated includes the option period. An eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.

Any Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation.

"DWP_19023 1-6",Contract,"DEPARTMENT FOR WORK AND PENSIONS",Awarded,2018-02-20T14:27:57Z,"Work and Health Programme","The Work and Health Programme (WHP) has been designed in line with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) five key objectives as set out in the single Departmental Plan : 2015 to 2020, along with plans for how these will be achieved and measured. They are to:
• run an effective welfare system that enables people to achieve financial independence by providing assistance and guidance into employment;
• increase saving for, and security in, later life;
• create a fair and affordable welfare system which improves the life chances of children and adults;
• deliver outstanding services to our customers and claimants; and
• deliver efficiently: transforming the way we deliver our services to reduce costs and increase efficiency. 
DWP will always positively seek to improve and introduce efficiencies in its operations and delivery. DWP will work with the supplier where such improvements impact on processes associated with this Programme.
DWP currently provides additional employment support to those in (or at risk of) long-term unemployment through contracted provision. The largest such contracted provision is the Work Programme. Persons who have a disability with more complex issues are currently assisted by Work Choice, voluntary contracted employment provision which helps participants achieve and stay in employment.Referrals to both the Work Programme and Work Choice are scheduled to end in 2017. 
The economic climate and the labour market are considerably stronger than when the Work Programme and Work Choice programmes were designed and introduced. 
Given the current labour market conditions the reduced unemployment rate and the improved economic conditions, the contracted employment provision of the future can be smaller and provide more focused support. It will need to provide additional and more intensive support than Jobcentre Plus can offer and deliver sustained employment outcomes above a specified earnings threshold.
The WHP is part of a new Personal Support Package for people with health conditions and disabilities set out in the Work, Health and Disability Green Paper . Making progress on the manifesto ambition to halve the disability employment gap is central to the Government's social reform agenda of building a country and economy that works for everyone. 
The WHP will be DWP's new contracted employment provision that will help persons who have a disability, the long term unemployed (LTU) and specified disadvantaged groups to find sustained work. The WHP will target those who are most likely to benefit from the additional support of the programme and will:
• provide additional support that is distinct and additional to that available through Jobcentre Plus;
• predominantly remunerate suppliers on a Payment by Results (PbR) basis in order to drive sustained employment outcomes; and

ESPO will impose on economic operators requirements aimed at protecting the confidential nature of information made available throughout the procurement procedure (as permitted by Regulation 21(3)) and, before receiving that information, economic operators will be required to complete and return a confidentiality agreement, which will be available once economic operators have expressed an interest in the tender opportunity.

The supplier must at all times hold a valid electricity supply licence granted by OFGEM, and any other qualification as required by legislation throughout the duration of the framework.

As a central purchasing body as defined by the EU Procurement Directive 2014/24/EU (""the Directive""), the framework agreement is open for use by contracting authorities (as defined by the Directive) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: local authorities; educational establishments (including academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; police, fire& rescue and coastguard emergency services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including ambulance services; registered charities; registered social landlords; or any contracting authority established by or under the Scotland Act 1998or any Act of the Scottish Parliament.

ESPO are creating this framework in reaction to interest and demand in a fixed price solution from independent customers, schools or multi-academy trusts covering a number of smaller sites. Feedback to ESPO suggests that these customers would often rather a fixed price solution as this could provide multiple benefits; budgetary certainty across a fixed time period, decreased exposure to market forces such as oil pricing, and an increased flexibility of options when approaching the market for their energy requirement. Lot 1 - Electricity (Non Half Hourly) Lot 2 - Electricity (Half Hourly) Lot 3 - Electricity (Unmetered Supply) Lot 4 - Gas The supplier must at all times hold a valid Electricity and/or Gas Supply License (as relevant to the awarded lots) granted by OFGEM and any other qualification or license as may be required by legislation throughout the duration of the framework. ESPO will impose on economic operators requirements aimed at protecting the confidential nature of information made available throughout the procurement procedure (as permitted by Regulation 21(3)) and,before receiving that information, economic operators will be required to complete and return a Confidentiality Agreement, which will be available once economic operators have expressed an interest in the tender opportunity. ESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself. Any Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt,not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation.

Family Mosaic as a group is looking to develop approximately 1,000 new homes per year, across all tenures to reflect Government changing priorities, whilst maintaining a programme of affordable rent by generating cross subsidy through developing shared ownership, private sale and market rent new homes. The proportion of each tenure will dependent on each site and location.
In addition to the above Family Mosaic as Lead Registered Provider will on occasions provide development services to other RPs as part of its funding agreements with the GLA and HCA, together with other separate legal entities formed for specific projects or programmes (these companies are either whole owned or partially owned by a member of the Family Mosaic Group).
Family Mosaic's new works construction programme over the four years duration of this framework is estimated to be in the region of 740 million GBP, with 30% of this delivered by S106s, leaving a balance of 518 million GBP pounds of directly instructed construction works. In addition to the Family Mosaic's programme this framework is being procured on behalf of other Registered Providers and Local Authorities who may wish to develop within London (the GLA area) and Essex, and who wish to sign up to Family Mosaic Framework. This will enable framework suppliers to access an additional volume of work and reduce their pre-qualification costs. At present there is no other RPs or LAs signed up, but to allow scope for this possibility the value of this framework construction costs are estimated not to exceed 600 million GBP.
Family Mosaic Housing wishes to establish a Framework Agreement for Contractor Services with contractors who can deliver on this varied programme together with supplying these services to other Registered Providers and Local Authorities who register to use this Framework for the purposes detailed above in the geographical area of Greater London and Essex.
The scope of this framework is principally to cover new mixed tenure residential developments above the EU procurement threshold, with a majority of the contracts in the range of 5 million GBP to 15 million GBP. For contracts below threshold Family Mosaic may opt to procure from SMEs and for exceptionally large contracts, regeneration projects choose to separately advertise these opportunities as part of an OJEU process. To ensure that Contractors who are appointed to the framework have sufficient financial capacity to carry out contracts on this framework a minimum annual turnover requirement has been set of 18 million GBP (see PQQ).",,,"East of England,London","45210000 45111000 45000000 45211200 45211000 45211100 45211300 45211341 45211340 45200000 ","Cora Marler",cora.marler@sweettgroup.com,"Albion House","20 Queen Elizabeth Street",London,"SE1 2RJ","              England

The Ministry intends to establish a multi-participant framework agreement. The agreement will operate on the basis that orders will be placed (following a mini-tender) and the successful supplier will act as Principal Contractor with single point of responsibility for the management and delivery of a specific project at 1 (or more) MOD establishment(s) located within South West England. The Framework Agreement will be for a period of 4 years, with options to extend for up to a further 3 years, taken at the discretion of the Ministry. Other UK Contracting Authorities (as referred to in VI.3) with requirements for the types of works & services referred to in this notice and which may be classified as sensitive works or sensitive services within the scope of Directive 2009/81/EC may subject to the exact nature of their requirement (and in particular subject to it falling within the scope of the said directive) and subject to the prior approval of the Ministry, call off the framework.
The successful supplier appointed under each call off from the Framework Agreement, will be responsible for co-ordinating and integrating the activities of their supply chain including consultants, subcontractors and suppliers and performing all tasks necessary to achieve the stated requirements and demonstrate fitness for purpose. The framework agreement will include delivery of such services related to the construction of new buildings and facilities, refurbishment of existing buildings and infrastructure work as the Ministry may require. It is envisaged that detailed design will normally be included for projects procured through the Framework Agreement. Some projects may require the successful supplier to undertake the entirety of the design process, including the development and completion of the full design and all work associated with planning applications. Maintenance of completed projects may be required during a ""compliance period"" to establish that performance in accordance with anticipated design parameters is being achieved. The specific projects that may be procured under the Framework Agreement cannot be clearly defined at this stage but the principal intention is that it shall be generally available for use for procuring projects up to the approximate value of GBP 12 000 000 at the discretion of the Ministry but there shall be no exclusivity nor any guaranteed volume of work.

HO/15/01,Contract,"HOME OFFICE",Awarded,2018-12-11T13:00:32Z,"Provision of In-Country and Overseas Escorting, operation and management of Short Term Holding Facilities and Holding Rooms and related services","The Home Office is responsible, under the Immigration Act 1971 and the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, for detaining and/or enforcing the removal of certain persons (detainees) from the UK.
The Immigration enforcement directorate of the Home Office is responsible for the provision of escorting services and detention.
At any one time, approximately 3400 detainees are held overnight in one of the Immigration Removal Centres, residential Short Term Holding Facilities, prisons and police stations across the United Kingdom. In addition, persons can be detained for shorter periods of time in holding rooms at reporting centres, land and sea ports.
This often entails the provision of transportation for detainees and escorts who will travel with them to their final destination and hand them over to the appropriate authorities. This will include vulnerable detainees, (e.g. with a medical condition), as well as those who refuse to leave the UK voluntarily and those being removed on chartered flights.
The Home Office has sought a commercial partner for the provision of a number of distinct, but fully integrated services. These services include (but are not limited to):
- the escorting and transportation of detainees within the UK (In-Country escorting services),
- the escorting of detainees from the UK to and from an overseas destination (Overseas escorting),
- management of detainees detained at holding rooms and Short-term Holding Facilities (STHFs),
- operation and management of Short-term holding facilities.
The escorting and transportation of persons who are subject to the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 may also be required.
There may also be a requirement to escort service users for other government departments.
The Contract value of 514 206 657 GBP at todays prices is a whole life cost for the full contract period of 10 years.",,,"Any region","60000000 79713000 79993000 98341000 ","Escorting Procurement Project Team",esprocurement@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk,"Home Office","7th Floor, Southern House, Weslely Grove",Croydon,"CR0 1XG",England,,http://www.gov.uk/home-office,"Redacted - 2018 Escorting Services - Part 1 of 2.zip Redacted - 2018 Escorting Services - Part 2 of 2.zip ","http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:378874-2016:TEXT:EN:HTML http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:340796-2016:TEXT:EN:HTML http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:235795-2018:TEXT:EN:HTML ",,01/05/2018,30/04/2028,04/11/2016,YES,HO/15/01,Yes,Yes,No,Services,514206657,,30/04/2018,514206657,"[MITIE CARE AND CUSTODY LIMITED|1 Harlequin Office Park

EBC wants to respond to the energy sector's trilemma of increasing prices, future shortage of supply, and the need to reduce carbon emissions. EBC also wants to be prepared for the challenges and uncertainty the food chain will face when major global food regions are under threat from extreme weather patterns. The JV arrangement may involve services, works or supplies being developed and delivered and commercial opportunities taken forward over the next 20 - 30 years in a number of sectors: Energy, Transport Food, Waste and Water. The main place of performance will be the geographic areas of Kent, Surrey, Brighton and Hove, East Sussex and West Sussex (the 'JV Areas') but may extend to the UK over the life of the joint venture.

Mayfield Partnership Ltd seeks a Private Sector Developer Partner (PSDP) to join a Joint Venture Vehicle (JVV)to redevelop the site.

The successful PSDP will be required to bring to the JVV imagination, flair and commercial acumen to ensure the delivery of a high quality, mixed use scheme. The PSDP will be responsible for the delivery of a wide range of development activity including masterplanning, site assembly, development in accordance with relevant SRF,planning applications, enabling infrastructure provision, procurement of construction contractors for the re-development, securing capital/funding and delivery of asset management/disposal which may involve marketing and positioning. Further details are provided in the procurement documentation.

Applicants should note the possibility that further elements may ultimately form part of this contract opportunity.Whilst it is not anticipated that the full range of options will be identified during the procurement process Mayfield Partnership Ltd recognises that:
— Network Rail owns (or will own by virtue of delivering the Northern Hub) a number of railway arches and small freehold sites either within or proximate to the Site's existing red line boundary. Whilst they are not part of the Site, some or all of these interests may, at some point in the future, be introduced into Mayfield Partnership Ltd's land holding and could involve Network Rail joining Mayfield Partnership Ltd;
— it is possible that other development opportunity sites may be added to the Site and/or delivered by the JVV or the successful joint venture partner during the life of the JVV, but it is not anticipated that these sites will be identified during the procurement process;
— it is also possible that the members of Mayfield Partnership Ltd might wish to develop and/or fund office elements of the project separately from the JVV, eg to meet the requirements of an anchor tenant(s). In this scenario, the intention is that the PSDP should act in a Development Manager role (in relation to these elements) for an agreed fee.

The Contracting Authority intends to procure the Contract for its own benefit & for others to whom it has an obligation to provide certain services. It is anticipated that the Contract will cover a wide range of services & some works elements incl without limitation the following: 
- Building Services
- Property & Asset Management
- Facilities Management
- Catering
- Cleaning
- Miscellaneous building related services
-          Capital works projects (especially in relation to schools)
-          Architectural design & related services
This list is not exhaustive & consideration may be given during the procurement process to the inclusion of additional services or options for additional services which will assist in delivering the Services. 
The Framework Agreement (FA)
In addition, the Contracting Authority is keen to make the benefits of the Services delivered under the Contract available to publicly funded schools & other public bodies in the area. 
The Contracting Authority is therefore seeking to procure a separate FA or the Services & services substantially similar to the Services.  The Contracting Authority will be acting as a central purchasing body through which the following organisations may choose, but shall not be obliged, to procure the Services using the FA: 
(1)    the other local authorities & publicly funded bodies that are identified in Annex A of the OJEU Contract Notice; & 
(2)    all publicly-funded schools & other educational establishments within the geographical areas of the Contracting Authority & the Participating Bodies. 
Accordingly it is the intention that all these organisations should be able to rely on this procurement to purchase such services without the need for any further procurement process.  For the avoidance of doubt, whereas the Contracting Authority currently provides some of the Services (for example, school catering services) to local schools as part of its own arrangements, it is intended that this will in future be carried via the FA, rather than the Contract. 
 
The duration of an individual call-off contract under the FA will not necessarily be limited to four years but will be governed by the precise subject matter of the call-off contract concerned. 
The form of the call-off contract will be agreed during the current procurement process & set out in the final FA, subject to the right to make specific amendments in respect of an individual call-off. 
No guarantee or warranty is given as to the nature or volume, if any, of the Services or the number of call-offs, if any, under the FA. 
It should also be noted that in addition to any change in the structure or identity of the Contracting Authority &/or the Participating Bodies in the event of re-structuring within local government, this procurement &/or the Contract & any FA awarded will pass to successor authoritie",,,"Yorkshire and The Humber","79993000 ",,zrobinson@wakefield.gov.uk,"Wakefield Council, Wakefield One, Burton Street",,Wakefield,"WF1 2EB",England,,,,,,31/10/2016,30/10/2023,15/04/2016,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,500000000,,26/07/2016,500000000,"[Engie Services Limited|Shared Services Centre

"Grand Union Housing Group",Contract,"CIRRUS PURCHASING LTD",Awarded,2016-03-02T13:04:31Z,"Cirrus Consortium Materials Framework","The Cirrus Consortium (The Consortium) is a procurement consortium that currently consists of in excess of 60 members including Registered Providers of Social Housing, Local Authorities, ALMOs and NHS Trusts. Members are based across England, Wales and Scotland, with additional organisations joining on a regular basis. 

The Cirrus Consortium is seeking to establish a new framework of multiple suppliers for the supply of building materials and associated services to expand upon The Consortium's existing highly successful materials framework. 

The Consortium is seeking bids for the following lots:

- Lot 1: General building materials (including paint and tools)
- Lot 2: Plumbing and heating materials (including gas spares and renewables)
- Lot 3: Electrical materials
- Lot 4: Kitchen materials
- Lot 5: Managed stores

Bidders can bid on one or more lots.

The outcome of the tender process will be a four year framework agreement expected to commence during May 2016. It is envisaged that the final framework will be awarded to approximately 15 suppliers per lot for lots 1 to 4, and 6 suppliers for lot 5. 

The framework is to cover call-off contracts made within England, Scotland and Wales, but excludes Northern Ireland. The framework is available for use by all contracting authorities as defined by Regulation 2 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 #102, including but not limited to the definable groups referenced in Schedule 4 of the Framework Agreement. 

The framework is also available for use by all current and future members of The Consortium.

Call-off contracts will be awarded by contracting authorities in accordance with the rules as defined by Regulation 33 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 #102. For the avoidance of doubt, the trading and invoicing relationship will be directly between the relevant framework supplier(s) and the relevant contracting authority/authorities.

Call-off contracts may be awarded on a direct award basis or through the use of mini-competitions as set out in the Framework Agreement.

The duration and size of any call-off contract is likely to vary at the discretion of individual consortium members. Where mini-competitions are undertaken, consortium members reserve the right to amend and refine the relative weightings of elements where appropriate for call-off contracts. The specific mini-competition competitive award criteria and relative weightings will be set on a case by case basis.

BIP54923524,Contract,"Ministry of Defence, Ships, Maritime Platform Systems (MPS)",Awarded,2017-07-07T09:00:08+01:00,"Marine Systems Support Partner","Platform Systems (MPS) team, which is part of the Ships Operating Centre within Defence Equipment & Support organisation, provides global support to Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships and submarines. 
      In planning for the future, the Ships Operating Centre is driving forward a Common Support Model, transforming support delivered to all complex warships by a converged, high performing, cost effective support model underpinned by a common approach to class, design and equipment management.  The aspiration is to have the Common Support Model in place in time to support the Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carriers and Type 45 Destroyers from the end of November 2016.  
      As part of the Common Support Model, MPS is planning to transform its organisation structure and ways of working from equipment to systems lines, by implementing its new Marine Systems Hub (MSH).  To support its implementation of the MSH, and in view of the timelines to support QEC/T45, MPS is considering contracting for one or more Support Partners, who will be responsible for working alongside the MOD team to provide a range of services covering spares, systems repairs and post design services (including provision of technical SQEP) for maritime platform equipment. The support will primarily cover T45 and QEC but legacy equipment may be incorporated in the future, and as appropriate, future warship and submarine platforms in the Fleet. 
      In view of the diverse nature of the equipment MPS has described this requirement as 4 systems - Power & Propulsion; Environmental, Domestic & Habitability; Platform Systems; Mechanical & Constructive; allowing a maximum of four contracts to be placed. A single contract may be placed if all four systems are awarded to one company as they provided the Most Economically Advantageous Tender for each System.
      The potential contract/s will be placed with Platform Systems Support Partner(s) who will be required to undertake Engineering and Logistics support activities for T45/QEC Systems and Equipment and will discharge these responsibilities as part of the Systems Technical Authority (STA).  The role of the STA is to provide guidance and advice to the MPS Systems Approving Authority (SAA), who has responsibility for ensuring system integrity on behalf of the Platform Safety Duty Holder.  
      
      The STA will provide assurance to the SAA:
      •	that design change has been holistically integrated into the relevant system; 
      •	provide evidence-based assurance to the SAA that the solution meets the Design Intent at the system level; 
      •	Supports Ships OC Duty Holders in diagnosing system failures and providing an emergency response service to the Navy on constraints to be placed on operational activity when using systems outside their design intent; and 
      •	Identifies opportunities for improvement of system design.
      
      In some instances the Authority may consider delegating the equipment approving authority role to the STA.",,,"South West","71336000 35522000 50640000 71356300 35520000 ","Paul Houston",julia.filer340@mod.gov.uk,"Birch 3A, #3320, NH3","Abbeywood South",Bristol,"BS34 8JH",UK,'+443067934173,,,,"To view this notice, register as a supplier here:

ESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are
third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.
Any Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.

The service specification sets out the range of Community Home Care services that the Council wants to make available, and the outcomes to be achieved as defined by the individual Service Users. The city will be split into 6 geographical areas, and one Primary Service Provider will operate in each of these areas. A framework agreement will also operate to supplement the primary contracts.  The Community Home Care services specified must be available to all people over the age of 18 who meet the Care Act 2014 eligibility criteria for funded support. However, the majority of people using these services will be older people. This Service responds to two significant developments in social care policy:  · A shift in focus from service inputs and outputs to the outcomes Service Users want to achieve  · That Leeds City Council promotes the introduction of Self-Directed Support through Personal Budgets, with people having more choice and control over the services they receive either through a Personal Budget or by ISF  Community Home Care is a simple way of describing the support that people receive to look after themselves and the homes they live in. The Specification incorporates Community Home Care for people who require an appropriate level of support and/or personal care and meet the Council`s eligibility criteria under: The Care Act, Care and Support (Eligibility Criteria) Regulations 2014 (the 'Eligibility Regulations'). The threshold is based on identifying how a person's needs affect their ability to achieve relevant outcomes, and how this impacts on their wellbeing.  The Specification introduces and requires new ways of working. The Council is keen to work with Service Providers to achieve the requirements in the Specification and to negotiate ways to deliver the specified outcomes. We welcome innovative approaches that add value and improve the quality of local, Community Home Care for people with eligible needs.

The successful supplier must able to provide associated services, such as Automated Meter Reading (AMR) and site works.

ESPO will impose on economic operators requirements aimed at protecting the confidential nature of information made available throughout the procurement procedure (as permitted by Regulation 21(3)) and, before receiving that information, economic operators will be required to complete and return a Confidentiality Agreement, which will be available once economic operators have expressed an interest in the tender opportunity.

ESPO proposes to establish a commercial trading company whose target clients will be third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector.  The successful Supplier will be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with that commercial trading company on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.

The Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other procurement legislation.  Trading Company No 1 will enter into the framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other procurement legislation.  Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.

A second company will be contracted by ESPO to manage and administer the first framework agreement for ESPO in relation to certain contracting authorities.  This company will not affect the contractual relationship with the successful bidder save to the extent that the company will be responsible for the marketing and administration of the framework agreement and will also, at the election of ESPO, be able to collect a proportion of the Retrospective Rebate in respect of the work it does.  The framework agreement will not otherwise change and customers will call off service contracts directly with the Supplier.

The proposed contract is for 10 years starting on 1 March 2018 with an optional extension of a period of 5 years. The services are currently provided in-house by the Council. The centres are well-thought of by local residents, and feature in the resident's survey 'top three things' about living in the Borough and the Council wishes to ensure this continues. The Council will only award the contract if sufficient savings can be made while maintaining the high quality service. The procurement is being let in two separate lots - Lot 1: Bracknell Leisure Centre and Coral Reef and Lot 2: Downshire Golf Complex. Suppliers may bid for one or both Lots. Turnover on all facilities in 2015/16 was £6.7m. Budgeted turnover in 2016/17 is £7.1m, reflecting the reopening of Coral Reef in 2017 after the Council's investment of c.£13m. The Concession Contract Regulations 2016 apply to this procurement (the 'CCR') and the services are ""social and other specific services"" coming under Schedule 3 of CCR. As such the full requirements of the CCR do not apply. The Council is only bound to the extent applicable to Schedule 3 services. The Council intends to follow a ""quasi-restricted procedure"". Details of the procurement are set out in the procurement documentation. If a supplier is selected to tender in both Lots, at tender stage it will be required to submit a separate statement (""Combined Statement"") setting out the benefits and efficiencies to the Council if it is awarded a contract under both Lots. The Council will set out its methodology for evaluating the Combined Statements in its evaluation methodology within the ITT documentation. Selection Questionnaires must be returned by the 31st March 2017. Organisations must specifically register their interest on the South East Business Portal in order to be kept informed of any changes or notifications regarding this process.

The capability covers the 3 primary biometric modalities of fingerprint, DNA and facial image associated with searches, verification checks and profile storage for our business user.The enrolment, matching, storage and reporting of fingerprints and facial images is provided for the Authority through two legacy systems.

The purpose of the STA is to develop and administer National Curriculum Assessments (NCAs) and assessments in England as part of the government’s agenda to raise educational standards through structural change, school improvement strategies, and a rigorous accountability framework where tests in the core subjects, currently at the end of Year 6 form an important measure of children’s long-term education and life chances. The outcomes of the NCAs are published annually at an individual school level in the School Performance Tables by government and are an important factor in parental choice of schools.

The current NCAs are Key Stage 1 (“KS1”) and Key Stage 2 (“KS2”) tests in the core subjects of English and Mathematics, and the KS1 Phonics Screening Check (“PSC”).   The tests are sat by the full cohort of pupils, currently 580,593 in 15,500 state schools in England.   

The successful economic operator will be required to undertake activities required for the successful delivery of all NCAs.   This will include: printing; the logistics associated with securely delivering test papers and other materials to participating schools; collecting and distributing tests scripts to markers; the successful completion of onscreen marking of the NCAs within a defined time frame; and to deliver all support required by participating schools for their successful administration of the NCAs.

UKVI's strategic ambition for FES (UK) is to create a streamlined, digitised and accessible application service, whilst offering a choice for customers in how they experience that service and facilitate opportunities to generate revenue that align with customer demand. UKVI's ambition is to move, where appropriate, to a self-service, digital experience for all parts of the application process. UKVI believes that there is a role for a commercial supplier in achieving this ambition within the UK and particularly to diversify the offer, deliver efficiency and enhance the customer experience. The services in the scope of this procurement fall into three main categories; • core services, • priority services, and • added value services. These services will be contracted for a three year period with an option for the Authority to extend for up to two additional years. Core Services • Biometric capture, • Identity check, and • Digitisation of supporting evidence. The FES (UK) Supplier will be required to provide the biometric capture hardware and software and transmit individuals' biometric data in a way that reconciles with the Authority systems.

Since 2006 that requirement has largely been met by the World Wide Food Services Contract. It is now inteneded to split the requirement into four separate contracts covering: the supply of food within the UK; dog food; in-flight catering and the supply of food to overseas locations. The overseas element will be met by this contract, the Overseas Deployable Food Programme (ODFP).] 
      The Overseas Deployable Food Programme  requirement aims to deliver a cost effective, fully optimised, low risk feeding capability to meet the requirements of the British Armed Forces and entitled personnel for all areas within scope, in accordance with the agreed UK, EU and Defence applicable quality and sustainability standards. 
      The term of the contract is 5 years with the possiblity of 2 x 1 year options available at the discretion of the Authority, with an approximate maximum value of £150,000,000 . It is estimated that the cost of food will account for approximately 30% of this, with non-food costs (logistics capabilities to source, store and transport the food) accounting for approximately 70% of the value of the contract . 
      The potential provider shall manage the supply chain to source and deliver fresh, ambient, chilled and frozen food products from core ranges of approximately 1000 lines (which may vary depending on location and scope).  A representative example of the tyrpical types and range of products is as follows:
      Fresh vegetables and salad - cauliflower, cucumber, onions, leeks, fresh herbs, broccoli and potatoes.
      Ambient - canned Ham, tuna chunks in brine, mushy peas, canned red kidney beans, canned fruit cocktail, sultanas, cereals, apple juice tetrapack, biscuits, tea bags
      Chilled - cheese, eggs, margarine, butter, milk, meat products (beef striploin, beef mince, lamb leg, pork leg)
      Frozen -  Pork and beef sausages, cod, fish fingers, ice cream, bacon, ice cream
      
      They will also be required to provide inflight frozen bricks, for a limited range of inflight meals, to locations as directed by the MOD.
      
      There may be a requirement for the potential provider to provide, at six months notice, a catering function in support of enduring stabilisation operations, for example the provision of Chefs and associated supporting staff.
      
      Delivery of food will be to permanent and exercise locations overseas as directed by the MOD (static and greenfield), including: the British Forces South Atlantic Islands, Kenya, and overseas operations that potentially could be in hostile and remote locations. Examples of recent regular Exercise locations have included, but are not limited to: Norway, USA, Spain, Denmark, Germany and Oman.

Each year the NHS provides around 110 million urgent same day patient contacts, with around 85 million of these being urgent GP appointments and the remaining being though A&E or minor injury clinics.
In Sussex the NHS 111 service takes around 363,000 calls a year, with 75% being taken out of hours (6.30pm-8am).  Within the existing Kent, Medway Surrey and Sussex contract around 43% of the total calls taken are for Sussex.
The Commissioners have agreed to offer the contract as a 5 year initial term with a single option to extend forup to a further two years (5 +2 = 7 years maximum duration) at the sole discretion of the Commissioner. The Commissioners will take the view to extend to the full seven years as soon as it is appropriate but with the first consideration at 18 months and thereafter at regular intervals. The vision for a more integrated urgent care system across Sussex will improve patient care and choice, as well as, streamlining and improving services for staff working in both primary and urgent care. The new NHS 111, Clinical Assessment Service and Out of Hours Service will be vital in the journey to integrate urgent care across Sussex. 
The Commissioners have set a maximum total financial envelope of £72.72m for the seven year maximum duration of the contract.
The new service will need to be in place by 1st April 2019, and the Commissioners expect to complete the procurement process and award the contract during August 2018.
The deadline for submission of completed bids is Thursday 29th March 2018 at 12:00pm (midday).

ESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself. Any Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.

The Contract will be for an initial 5 year period with an option to extend in 1 yearly increments reviewed on an annual basis. (1+1)
The potential Contract value is £75.4m. 
This Contract will be between the successful Supplier and the Buyer (not the Crown Commercial Service (CCS))
The Contract is being offered under Lot 1a of the Workplace Services (FM Marketplace Phase 2) (RM6089) which will govern any resultant Contract.
The competition is being managed in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015. This is a Call Off Contract and as such the Buyer cannot guarantee volumes of work.
HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) is the UK's tax, payments and customs authority, and has a vital purpose: collect the money that pays for the UK's public services and help families and individuals with targeted financial support. HMRC (the Buyer) does this by being impartial and increasingly effective and efficient in our administration. HMRC help the honest majority to get their tax right and make it hard for the dishonest minority to cheat the system. HMRC has 3 strategic objectives: 
	maximise revenues due and bear down on avoidance and evasion
	transform tax and payments for our customers
	design and deliver a professional, efficient and engaged organisation
The HMRC Strategic Asset Management plan sets out how the Estate will contribute to these objectives. 
HMRC must look to continually adapt to the changing needs and expectations of our customers, the government and other stakeholders. The Buyer is transforming the way HMRC do business and has already made big changes to the way HMRC works, helping us to bring in more revenue than ever before. 
2.7.2.1	Our network of Regional Centres will need a Security Services supplier that can support HMRC through its estate transformation. This supplier will also be required to provide Security Services at other buildings across the HMRC Estate including for specialist and transitional sites. HMRC requires  excellent Security Services customer service and satisfaction rates, technology that will support efficiencies in our Estate and effectiveness of our staff and suppliers who are innovative, forward thinking and are leaders in their field but ones that can also understand and work with HM Government governance and spend controls.

The following information is applicable to all lots: ESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself. Any Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation.
