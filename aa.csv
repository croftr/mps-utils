The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) regulates auditors, accountants and actuaries and sets the UK's Corporate Governance and Stewardship Codes. 

The FRC is also a prescribed body for issuing accounting standards in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The FRC's overriding objective in setting accounting standards is to enable users of accounts to receive high-quality, understandable financial reporting proportionate to the size and complexity of the entity and users' information needs.

This research project will engage with UK companies to gather data about their use of a particular UK accounting standard: FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. However, the project will not require the successful contractor to have specialist knowledge of accounting.

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

(1) Groups applying FRS 101
The research will collect information from groups of companies that have chosen to apply FRS 101 in the preparation of UK qualifying entities' financial statements. For these groups,  below is a snapshot of what we would like to know:

a)	the most significant reasons for preparers' choice to apply FRS 101 to the financial statements of qualifying group entities, and who (i.e. which job function) made this decision; 
b)	which of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions preparers consider to be useful, less useful, and why; 

(2) UK listed groups not applying FRS 101

The research will also engage with UK listed groups that could have chosen to apply FRS 101 in the preparation of qualifying entities' financial statements but did not do so. For these groups,  below is a snapshot of what we would like to know:

a)	the most significant reasons why UK listed groups choose not to apply FRS 101, and who (which job function) makes this decision;
b)	what, if any, changes to FRS 101 would make these preparers likely to consider applying FRS 101 in the future and why these changes would be beneficial; and

The research will identify prevalent views and concerns of UK listed groups. It should therefore include a sufficient number of participants of each type to ensure that prevalent views are identified. The FRC will consider significant matters identified by the research in more detail and may seek further evidence through its own stakeholder consultation and outreach activities.

The research population will be UK groups listed on the London Stock Exchange Main Market (LSE MM - comprising FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 constituents, plus smaller main market listed entities) and the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market (LSE AIM). In total this is expected to be approximately 2,000 groups.

      The University is looking for a partner to host our public website as well as blogs sites and other sites related to the university.  The host will have a minimum of six years experience, with at least 1,000 plus customers.  There is a requirement for the ability to install multiple WordPress sites with the facility to allow a multisite system on a WordPress site where needed. 
      
      The University of Northampton existing managed hosting contract is due to expire and so are seeking a managed WordPress hosting service from Spring 2024.  This service needs to be hosted in preferably in the UK.  The hosting service will be required to host several WordPress sites, including a Restaurant site, Hotel Site, a Blog site with multi-sites enabled, Virtual Tour and the main University public website which runs multi sub-sites for areas of the university which require a public facing website.   
      
      The main University public website had over 3 million visitors in the last year and so the successful tenderer will need to be able to handle peaks of high activity/traffic.  Also, the successful tenderer will need to provide 24 hours per day monitoring of the public website ensuring issues can be detected and resolved quickly.  Over the period of the contract the University's AV, Digital and collaborative tools Team will also be moving websites, microsites and blogs which are used elsewhere within the university to the hosting solution.  This will include having multi-site enabled for some sites so that microsites and blogs can sit under their respective sites.  An example of this is Awards and Module catalogue ( https://www.northampton.ac.uk/awards/ ) currently sitting under the public website ( https://www.northampton.ac.uk/ ) installation.  The total hosting of at least 30 sites (A mixture of Live and Development/Staging sites) will be needed with expansion as more sites are brought into the hosting environment.  Our bandwidth usage is around 1.2TB a month with 959GB of this being taken up by our main public website and can go higher in our super busy periods such as Clearing and Welcome Week.  The total storage for all our websites is approximately 250GB at the present time but this is growing by approximately 2Gb a month.  However, we are unable to calculate two sites growth patterns as they have only recently come online.
      
      The ideal supplier will become a strategic partner for the duration of the contract which will be two years.  The supplier will need to add value by providing the University with support services, such as consulting and possible assistance with assurance of code along with the core provision of the managed platform and hosting.  This should include all software version and security updates as applicable during the term of the contract.

Greater Manchester has a strategic and spatial approach to priority infrastructure delivery and investement, in order to maximise economic growth across the conurbation. Through this approach, GM seeks to prioritise and sequence the investment needed to bring forward strategic growth propositions in a coherent way which supports GM's engagement with Government over future funding agreements and also connecting project delivery with broader placemaking and economic growth. 

The Wigan and Bolton Growth Corridor is one of six growth locations identified within the city region which represent opportunities for the whole region to bring forward development at scale that can drive the transformational change we want to see in GM.

The development of the Wigan & Bolton Growth Corridor will provide radial transport infrastructure across Wigan and Bolton, which will enable wider regeneration and economic growth ambitions to be realised.  The development of a quality bus corridor, motorway link road and enhanced rail, will connect residents to employment and skills opportunities within the Boroughs and across Greater Manchester. 

In line with residents needs and aspirations, c.12,000 new quality homes will be created.  These will include family homes and will be delivered across the distinctive communities with access to green space.  Building on the corridor's existing strengths and strategic transport links, employment growth will be driven by logistics, manufacturing (notably food) and distribution.

      Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council will be holding its Armed Forces Day event on Saturday 29 June 2024. We require sufficient security cover for this event, including patrol and overnight cover.
      
      Sandwell Armed Forces Day is a family friendly event that will see attendance of around 500 people per day (200 expected peak), and will be packed with family workshops and activities, live music, and entertainment.
      
      The event will run from 1100-1500 at Dartmouth Park, Reform Street, West Bromwich, B71 4AS.
      
      Cover is required for the following*:
      DATE ROLE NUMBER REQUIRED EXPECTED HOURS
      29/6/24 FREC3 2 1030-1530
      *Required staffing levels have been calculated using the Purple Guide classification of a Tier 1 event based on numbers and activities. Quotations should be based on the above, however actual cover may be subject to change following discussions and the production of an event medical plan.
      
      Sandwell Council Events Team take advice from The Purple Guide to Health, Safety and Welfare Music and Other Events. It is important to ensure that the right skills, experience and resources needed to provide safe and effective cover are available.
      
      The provider must hold appropriate Medical Defence and Public Liability Insurances and have rigorous clinical governance procedures in place. The provider must be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
      
      It is the responsibility of the medical provider to propose a medical plan for the event; whilst remaining commercially viable, this should set out a safe, effective and resilient service which will reduce the impact of the event on the local NHS as much as possible. 
      
      Details of the cover to be provided should be given in writing and contained in the formal medical plan. The medical plan should include details of any information-sharing protocol agreed between the named medical manager, the NHS and the event safety manager and any MOU between the medical provider and the local NHS Ambulance Service Trust. Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council must obtain information of medical issues and information on the event site. 
      
      Ambulances used on site should ideally be four-wheel drive capable especially where the event site is a green field site. 
      
      As per The Purple Guide guidance, a variety of roles may be required at an event including the following.
      
      Doctor
      A person currently registered as a doctor with the General Medical Council
      o Pre-hospital experience and acute care qualifications are desirable
      o Retired or honorary unregistered clinicians are ineligible
      
      Paramedic/Specialist Practitioner
      A person currently registered as a paramedic with the Health Care and Professionals Council

The introduction of flexible access drawdown. This might be described as the 'do it myself' option, where individuals want complete control.

The evolution of our lifelong income solution (building on the current Nest Guided Retirement fund and introducing a deferred annuity element). In contrast to flexible access drawdown this might be described as the 'do for me' option, where Nest takes the responsibility to delivering a sustainable lifelong income and the on-going decisions an individual must make are minimal.

      1. Historic England (the Authority) uses a legacy software application (TRIM version 7) for the management of non-electronic physical records.  Physical records managed in TRIM range from documents of historical significance to business and personnel paper records.
      
      2. TRIM has been through several iterations of product identity and original ownership since first implemented, prior to the establishment of Historic England, for English Heritage.  The version currently in service has been end of sale and out of vendor support for nearly a decade.  Historic England wishes to replace the functionality offered by TRIM through implementing a modern and fully supported digital solution that addresses operational risks and issues associated with continuing to run an obsolete and unsupported system.
      
      3. This requirement relates solely to the management of physical records.  While it is known that some candidate digital solutions also offer such functionality, management of electronic records is not in scope and does not require discussion.
      
      Objectives and Desired Outcomes
      
      4. Objectives of the work are:
      a. The contract with the successful supplier to implement and provide the digital solution commences April 2024.
      b. The solution is live by July 2024 and continues until April 2028.
      c. Support and operation of the solution is transitioned to business-as-usual by Septem-ber 2024.
      
      5. The outcomes that Historic England wishes to realise are:
      a. Physical records are managed using a solution with full original vendor support until at least April 2028.
      b. Historic England provides first and second-line support.  The successful supplier will provide third-line support.
      c. Users are trained, familiar, and at ease with using the solution.
      d. The solution enables the use of TRIM in Historic England to be discontinued and IT as-sets associated with TRIM to be decommissioned.
      
      Scope
      
      6. Within the successful supplier's scope in this engagement will be:
      a. A digital solution to manage physical records.
      b. Technical implementation of the solution.
      c. Migration of data from the legacy TRIM application to the new solution.
      d. Post-migration data validation.
      e. Provision of user guidance and any necessary training materials.
      f. Early-life support  following release to live.
      g. Support for the solution for the duration of the contract period.
      
      7. Outside of the successful supplier's scope of work will be any decommissioning of existing IT assets.
       
      Constraints
      
      8. Constraints on the solution are:
      a. The solution must be capable of single sign-on using credentials from the Historic Eng-land Azure Active Directory.
      b. The successful Tenderer must hold valid Cyber Essentials certification for the duration of the contract.
      c. Data must be hosted in the UK or European Economic Area only.

As one of its core activities The City of London grazes Epping Forest and its surrounding lands utilising a herd of pedigree Longhorn cattle. During the winter the cattle are housed at Great Gregories Farm where the cows will calve inside buildings. When ground conditions are favourable in the spring the cattle will then go out to graze. Currently the herd size is 200+ with plans to increase this year on year, currently we require at least 1100 bales a year from our own lands to feed the herd through the winter months.

Silage, haylage and hay needs to be cut at different times of year in order to preserve enough feed for the cattle and to meet the conservation needs of our grassland sites. In order to reduce plastics, we plan to cut at least 120 bales as hay (unwrapped) and store undercover at the farm. Most of the grasslands are unimproved and receive no fertiliser, they yield on average 10-15 bales a Ha. 

We are undertaking a tender process to appoint a contractor to produce our winter feed over a 5 year period.

We are having a purpose built hay shed erect June 2024 as move to having more bales made as hay (un-wrapped)

The appointed contractor will be expected to carry out the whole process. This will include:
Liaising with the Grazing and Landscape Manager on cutting dates
Ensuring cutting times and wilting duration are used to produce the best quality forage possible
Mowing, tedding, raking, baling, wrapping, transporting to Great Gregories Farm and stacking. Bales to be stacked no higher than 3 bales high. Any damage or splits to bales during stacking to be rectified with silage tape.

Refuge offers safe accommodation and intensive support which is tied to that accommodation in Bracknell. Victims, including their children, must be refuge residents to access specialist emotional and practical support. The refuge accommodation should ideally be located across one or two properties (in a maximum of three properties) in a safe, secure, and confidential location to ensure that women and children staying in refuge can access peer support.  A local area risk assessment needs to take place to establish that the location is discreet and appropriate for vulnerable women and their children (e.g., careful consideration to be given to other unsuitable properties in the vicinity of the refuge such as HMOs for single men). There are currently two refuges run by Berkshire Women's Aid (BWA) operating in Bracknell. These refuges are part of a BWA lease and do not form any part of this procurement process. Any new Service Provider will have to source their own property to operate the refuge service in Bracknell.\r
The Outreach service is available to women and men aged 16+ living in Bracknell Forest, and who are suffering from, or are threatened by, domestic abuse.\r
The contract duration will be for a maximum of 7 years, covering an initial period of 3 years plus 2 optional extensions, each of 2 years (3 + 2 + 2)\r

"C/REF 00000632",Contract,"HISTORIC ENGLAND LIMITED",Awarded,2024-05-16T11:20:09+01:00,"STA - Feasibility Study for Bethesda Chapel","The Historic Chapels Trust has begun a process of winding down and is in the process of seeking new owners for its chapels via a Disposals Programme.  The English Heritage Trust (EHT) is considering whether to take ownership of Bethesda Chapel, Hanley, Stoke on Trent, in line with their Acquisition Strategy (currently in draft form).  This is due to its historical significance and a geographic location in Staffordshire which is underrepresented by EHT sites. 

This brief is to produce a Feasibility Study for the chapel so EHT can make an informed decision. This study will build on, and update, the options appraisal in the Way Forward Report (Oct 2018) that was produced by the CCT.  That report recommended enhancement of the existing low key visitor attraction offer with mixed commercial and community arts, performance, and hospitality uses.

The preferred option for EHT is that the chapel be open to visitors, as a visitor attraction and to increase its financial viability, so the study will explore a mixed model of public access and commercial opportunities (beyond a typical visitor facility and EHT retail offer), to include further income opportunities for catering, retail, rental of spaces in the chapel, events.   

Since 2018 there have been developments in the local socio-economic context of Stoke on Trent.  EHT would like to explore potential partnerships, such as with the higher education, community, museums, ceramic and artist programmes and potential funding streams. Initial conversations with potential partners have identified a possible need for a cultural space for use by local organisations. The report produced will include identification of potential partners (including funding partners) and report on interviews held with these organisations which outline their requirements, aims, needs and desired outcomes.

The service will enable individuals to understand their mental disorder, identify their own key areas of strength and/or independence and live a life that matches their aspirations. It will promote resilience, purpose, autonomy, and the ability to make positive choices that sustain their wellbeing. Fundamentally, reducing risk to self/others and/or readmission to hospital.

Providers will need to be comprehensive and encompass all aspects of mental health to include physical, medical and psychological support.  Care Pathways will provide clear and timely assessments, assessing all needs to include those relating to risk from admission to discharge which are critical in avoiding duplication and preventing unnecessary delays.

People who will benefit from this service will be aged 18 years and over and may be:-

•	In or leaving Hospital (local acute wards and out of area hospitals including low secure estate)
•	Living with mental health in the community
•	Offenders who are at risk of causing harm to themselves or others
•	In treatment for substance misuse and mental ill-health
•	Using substances as a coping mechanism to manage their mental health and not currently accessing treatment support
•	Living in unsuitable accommodation

There should be no blanket exclusions to accessing the service.  However, people may be refused access to the service where providers can demonstrate an unmanageable risk is presented.  Where this is felt to be the case providers will be required to complete a Provider Support Assessment form to outline the reasons behind the refusal and whether there are any mitigating circumstances that would support their admission to the service. 

Referrals will come directly from the Housing with Care Team, following the Council's Accommodation Panel process, a single point of access for health professionals and adult social care workers based on need.  No self referrals will be permitted without a social care assessment.

Detailed survey and investigation has been carried out by Wirral Council Structural Engineers, who have identified 2 areas (Section C-E). The exact cause of the subsidence is not known for sure, but suspected a combination of water build up and tree root growth to be the most likely factors. As such the areas of wall require careful demolition and rebuilding using the same stones, but including the improved substructure and drainage measures as proposed by the Structural Engineer.

2024 sees the end of its current Festive lighting contract and with it, the end of the lease of the majority of its current Festive lights. Whilst KTC has been very happy with its Festive light design, this gives KTC the opportunity to consider a new display for the next three years, to suitably complement the lighting owned by the town and to reflect the market town heritage and atmosphere in the conservation area.
KTC is seeking suitably experienced companies to tender for design, supply, installation, maintenance, dismantling, storage, testing and operation of Christmas Lighting.
The focus of the illumination scheme is the annual 'switch on' event, the date for which is determined early in the year and is usually on a Friday in late November (Bright Friday) and the chosen Contractor would need to be present at this event to facilitate the lighting of the Christmas display in the market place.
In addition, from time to time, KTC has a requirement for spring/summer bunting to be erected/dismantled in the town and also for event banners to be erected/dismantled across the High Street.

This Framework operates at two levels - Level One, where any suitably qualified and eligible provider can submit details of all the apprenticeships they offer, and employers can then either direct award or, via Salisbury, conduct a further competition against their local needs. Level Two will be a smaller number of providers for a specific standard, appointed via a Further Competition, using a higher selection criteria published with each ITT. 

Both levels of listing are open across all our eligible public and third sector organisations. Level Two listed providers can be selected either by employer direct award or a further competition amongst those listed.

This Requirement document covers the April 2024 opening of the Framework and constitutes Instructions to Suppliers including mandatory requirements.

All Providers must agree to the Framework terms and conditions published as part of the Invitation to Tender (ITT) - amendments to those Terms will not be made for specific providers.

Please note the final selection of providers to award for a specific requirement is a decision for employers and this Framework does not represent a spend commitment by any organisation.

Incorrectly submitted responses will be rejected and the Trust is not obliged to offer an opportunity for suppliers to resubmit correctly. 


The framework opens twice a year to allow for the following :

1 - Existing providers to update their course listing (using the Excel document issued, previous framework documents will not be considered)

2 - New providers to apply to join the Framework

3 - Existing providers to advise of changes in their status, e.g. contact details or Ofsted rating, achievement rates, delivery methods etc.

4 - To allow for new standards approved by IfATE to be added to listings, or IfATE amended maximum funding bands to be reflected.

Existing providers MUST submit a response to this Opening if :

(a)	The courses offered have changed since previous listing (including withdrawing programmes)
(b)	The Provider did not submit a response during the April 2023 or October 23 opening (providers not doing so, and not responding to this opening, will be removed)

The setup needs to be able to work in presence of metallic lithium, and other alkali and alkaline earth metal electrodes. Therefore, Argon must be used to fill the glovebox rather than Nitrogen, and a Nitrogen filter needs to be provided in order to preserve the integrity of the electrodes and internal components of the cells.

 The asset must enable the safe production of electrodes and pouch and coin cell assembly on the following requirements:
1)	The equipment should provide a contained environment spacious enough for small scale electrode and cell fabrication equipment.
2)	The equipment should be equipped with a disk burst with predetermined breaking points in order to prevent overpressure in the box in case of battery thermal runaway.
3)	The equipment should be equipped with oxygen, moisture, and nitrogen sensors in order to ensure the quality of the atmosphere.
4)	The equipment should be equipped with a purging system.

Under the Service Operations Modernisation Programme (SOMP), National Highways is undergoing enhancements to improve Service Operations capability, modernise Services, reshape the Supplier landscape, and enhance the Operating Model of IT Service Operations.

As part of this transition towards the target operating model, we are establishing a new central Applications Function. This function will have clearly defined processes and supporting contracts to assume the overarching responsibility for applications across National Highways.

In parallel with the establishment of the central Applications Function, we are actively recruiting multiple technical resources. This approach aims to create a hybrid support model for application support, combining internal expertise with external resources as needed.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of our application estate, we have conducted a thorough discovery exercise. The findings reveal a significant number of applications, approximately 1200 in total. However, currently only 8% of these applications are fully managed by the Applications Team. Based on projected future demands, it is evident that we need to support hundreds of applications through a centrally managed team.

In summary, National Highways is proactively establishing a central Applications Function, recruiting technical resources, and conducting a comprehensive review of the application estate. Our goal is to enhance our support capabilities, improve the management of applications, and meet the evolving demands of the business.

This contract has been awarded to take on the full operational management of our existing suite of applications initially, under a standard contract with a fixed price. As part of this arrangement, additional applications will be gradually onboarded into the supplier&apos;s support framework through a call-off agreement.",,,"Any region","72416000 ","National Highways",enterprisesystemsprocurement@nationalhighways.co.uk,"199 Wharfside Street",,Birmingham,"B1 1RN",England,,,,,,29/06/2024,28/06/2029,01/11/2023,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,43490000,,03/04/2024,43490000,"[Version 1 Solutions Ltd|Suite 3D & E, Third Floor, 31 Temple Street, Birmingham, England, B2 5DB|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,29/06/2024,28/06/2029,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,17:00

Through this programme, Cefas provide authoritative scientific information on the marine and transitional waters in the vicinity of potential new build nuclear power stations.

The purpose of this procurement is to provide bathymetric data for the Greater Sizewell Bay (GSB) to assess the geomorphological changes of the region, hence contributing to the ongoing monitoring of the Sizewell Coastline.
Two longshore bars (important geomorphological features) exist in shallow waters within the Area of Interest (AOI), with the inner bar being subaerial during some low tide periods. The results gained from the below specified surveys will support the calibration of Cefas instruments located on shore, as well as the ongoing monitoring of the Sizewell coastline. There is a high priority for the furthest landward coverage possible to be achieved by the survey, so that bathymetric data can be meshed to aerial topographic surveys of the beach, typically undertaken at low tide.

In addition to the above, the survey also seeks to obtain Side Scan Sonar (SSS), alongside multibeam data, to detect the presence of potential Sabellaria reef in the offshore infrastructure area. This area has previously been surveyed and shown to comprise outcropping Coralline Crag, which supports Sabellaria formations, and as such the data should be of high enough quality to determine and detect potential reef areas.

Cefas require two shallow water Multibeam Echosounder (MBES) bathymetric surveys to IHO Special Order (at a minimum) within the Greater Sizewell Bay (GSB) as below:

1. Spring Survey - Full extent (offshore) bank survey (MBES) undertaken in the Spring/Summer months; with data collection in nearshore AOI (MBES) and an offshore infrastructure area (MBES and SSS) to be prioritised first.

This work focused on examining the current views and proposed approach of the insurance community to insuring FOW projects. Findings from the project highlighted areas of critical significance to insurers which this project can utilise in helping to determine the technology options and specific key risks to consider. The project will consider representative sites based on planned developments of both early small scale and future large-scale FOW. As seen in fixed-bottom, lessons learned and data shared from earlier small-scale FOW projects will help to influence insurers' approach to later large scale projects.\r
Building on this previous work, this project aims to quantify the financial implications of these key risks. Specifically, to outline the potential frequency of claims, the impact/size of claims and the activities in terms of cost and resources which will be required to resolve them.\r
This project has the opportunity to provide valuable findings to key stakeholders and wider industry to support the development of FOW. By assessing the areas of critical concern for insurers and identifying ways to mitigate and fill these existing gaps in coverage, the project will outline viable pathways to insurability for commercial scale FOW projects.\r

The Marine Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (mNCEA) programme is a flagship science innovation programme that is addressing integrating natural capital and ecosystem assessment approaches into policy and decision making for marine and coastal environments. Ecosystem assessment tells us about the health of our natural environment and how this is changing over time, whereas natural capital describes the economic, social and environmental value our natural assets hold for people, from food to carbon storage to health and wellbeing. The mNCEA programme is funded by Defra and delivered by its partners (The Arm's Length Bodies - ALBs)
Phase I of the Macroalgae Seagrass Model Development project, for the Land-sea Interface work in the mNCEA programme, was completed during October 2023 - March 2024. This phase provided analysis and data on seagrass occurrence within Langstone harbour (Ward and Preston, 2024) that informed development and calibration of the seagrass component within the extended CPM mode being developed under mNCEA (LSI) WP3.
Based on the recommendations in the technical report submitted to Cefas (Ward and Preston, 2024), and directly shaped by explicit data needs communicated by Cefas staff, Cefas require the supplier to provide the below services.
Requirement:
Cefas require the supplier;
1.
To provide feedback on the underlying principles, and utility of the Cefas CPM model.
2.
To provide an updated seagrass coverage spatial map for Langstone Harbour.
3.
To provide data on seasonal cycles of seagrass coverage at selected sites in Langstone harbour.
4.
To provide spatial estimates of seagrass above and below ground biomass.
5.
To collate suite of abiotic data to further characterise environmental conditions in relation to seagrass presence.
6.
To analyse which ranges of potentially predictive environmental variables, including depth, tidal inundation, bathymetric slope and current speed, correlate with known seagrass extent.",,,"Any region","71620000 ","Jade Peek",procure@cefas.gov.uk,"Pakefield Road",,Lowestoft,"NR33 0HT",GB,,,"CEFAS24-41 Short_Form_Contract - UoPv2 COMPLETE_Redacted.pdf ",,,10/05/2024,31/03/2025,23/04/2024,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,54000,54000,08/05/2024,54000,"[University of Portsmouth|University House, Winston Churchill Ave, Portsmouth PO1 2UP PO1 2UP|NONE||No|No]",,10/05/2024,31/03/2025,"SingleTenderActionNonOJEU ",,12:00

This procurement is being concluded following a mini competition under the Crown Commercial Services Research & Insight DPS RM6126.

Brief Description of Requirement
The Public Attitudes to Science (PAS)  series is the main broad-based evidence of public attitudes to science across the UK. UKRI took over responsibility for managing PAS from DSIT (formerly BEIS) in 2023. Our aim is that it should provide robust evidence that can be used with confidence in strategy, policy, and programme development. 

Our PAS supplier or consortium must have expertise in survey research, in particular so-called 'push-to-web-surveys,' strong science communication credentials and highly regarded networks across government, the research and innovation sector, and media. 

We want PAS to inspire debate and activity among policy makers, researchers, innovators, public engagement and sci-comm practitioners, and the media. The successful supplier will need to create outputs which are disseminated in a creative and ambitious way which creates significant, far-reaching impacts. 

This iteration of PAS will be based around the same set of core questions asked in 2019 and additional questions based on discussion with UKRI. The three waves of PAS will need to support the trend series while facilitating notable changes to the survey mode, survey frequency, and survey sample size. 

The successful supplier will deliver three waves of an online PAS survey. The estimated contract value is £1.2 million exclusive of VAT to deliver a minimum of 3,000 completed questionnaires in each of the three waves. 

There will be break clauses and review stages in the contract between each Wave to enable UKRI to manage the contract and its budget.",,,"United Kingdom","73000000 ","Kerry Hart",professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House,North Star Avenue",,SWINDON,SN21UH,England,"01793 867005",www.uksbs.co.uk,"PS24043 Contract Redacted.pdf ",,,10/05/2024,10/04/2026,22/03/2024,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,1200000,,10/05/2024,1200000,"[IPSOS (MARKET RESEARCH) LTD|3 Thomas More Square

"TSCN Marketing Tender",Contract,"East Riding of Yorkshire Council",Awarded,2024-05-14T12:41:22+01:00,"The Supply Chain Network Marketing Project","Procurement Opportunity 
TSCN is currently looking to procure an individual / organisation to review, develop and promote The Supply Chain Network's upgraded toolkit across the East Riding of Yorkshire and Hull with the purpose of promoting its upgraded benefits, driving traffic to the site and increasing long term engagement.
The purpose of the FREE toolkit , is to help businesses to promote their products and services and to give them awareness of regional work to ""make opportunities visible, accessible and winnable"".  

As part of this project, you will evaluate the current reach of TSCN website and develop ways to further promote the Supplier Directory and the Opportunities Map across SMEs and micro businesses alongside medium and large organisations. 

The promotional content will be centred around the benefits of the project, how they can register, the features and benefits of the site and promotion of current case studies. We are looking for a near immediate increase in the generation of leads and throughout the delivery of this project. The measurement of success for this contract will be the increase of traffic to the website (see goals below). This will be measured across the core audiences who use the toolkits.

The current site is being redeveloped to increase useability, improve the user experience and encourage more engagement resulting in more opportunities being posted and listings created. The current site, which has not been marketed heavily for the past 12 months currently receives approximately 50 new listings and 10 new opportunities per quarter. We don't currently have the data for interaction/hits on the current website.

Goals of the project:
Increase of listed businesses - 300 new sign ups
Increase in no. of tenders/opportunities - 50 new opportunities on the map
Increased awareness measured through sign ups 
Next 6 months of delivery planned out

TSCN Marketing tender brief v3.docx ",,"Background and context 

The Supply Chain Network (TSCN) supplier directory and opportunities map was created back in 2013 as part of the Green Port Growth programme supporting the development of the offshore wind and renewables sector across the Hull and East Riding region. To support this vision, the Green Port Growth Programme was set up to encourage supply chain development and diversification within the region, supporting local businesses to maximise the opportunities that the renewables industry presented over the following years.
It was quickly recognised that the toolkit was hugely beneficial in driving support and supply chains for the sector and that this could be utilised across all sectors. As a result the supplier directory and opportunities map took on The Supply Chain Network branding which was established including key strap lines, colour palette, tone of voice and graphics. 
You can see the original website in the link below:
https://www.thesupplychainnetwork.co.uk/

As we have worked through the Supply Chain Network project that ran from 2019-2023, it was identified that the supplier directory and opportunities map required some development work to make them both more interactive for our businesses and to improve the user experience. Whilst the overall project has been completed, it is recognised that the tools are a great support to all businesses in the region and they have been absorbed into the business support services toolkit. The supplier directory and opportunities map retain the supply chain network brand and will together constitute TSCN website. 

TSCN website is currently undergoing development work and is due to be re-launched mid-2024, with improved user experience and providing an easier way of registering, interactive tools made available for following businesses and opportunities, notifications to businesses and pro-actively providing information on opportunities across the region.

This contract has been awarded via the Crown Commercial Services - RM6313 - Demand Management and Renewables DPS **

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has a requirement to appoint a supplier to support the design and operation of the Heat Network
Technical Assurance Scheme (HNTAS) pilot programme.


The Energy Act 2023 provides for Ofgem to be appointed as regulator of the heat networks sector and grants Ofgem the power to authorise individuals to operate heat
networks and undertake supply activity. Ofgem will grant authorisation to a heat network operator, provided that the operator's network meets certain authorisation conditions. The
Energy Act provides for compliance with minimum technical standards to be included as one of these conditions. This lays the foundation for technical standards secondary
legislation which is expected to come into force in 2025 to introduce mandated minimum technical standards for heat networks (e.g. mandating requirements on water flow
temperatures, pipe insulation, etc). All heat networks (existing and new) across a range of different characteristics (large city sized district heating to single block communal
networks) will be in scope of this requirement. 

To promote compliance with these minimum technical standards, we are developing a Heat Network Technical Assurance Scheme (HNTAS). The technical specification
which sets out the minimum technical standards that heat network suppliers will need to adhere to, and that will be subject to assurance, is being written and is expected to be
completed in early 2024. Work is also underway to develop the assurance processes themselves, i.e. the procedures to assess compliance. Together, the technical
specification and assurance processes represent normative documents, i.e. a set of documents describing what heat suppliers must do. Once legislation is in place, it is intended
to designate these normative documents as a Code, adherence to which will be required in regulation.",,,"Any region","73200000 ","Buildings and Energy",fmprocurement@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House, North Star Avenue",,SWINDON,"SN2 1FF",England,01793867005,www.uksbs.co.uk,"BE24052 - Redacted Order Form.pdf BE24052 - Tender Documents.zip ",,,26/04/2024,30/06/2025,04/04/2024,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,1384480,,26/04/2024,1384480,"[Gemserv Limited|2nd Floor 77 Gracechurch Street London EC3V 0AS|COMPANIES_HOUSE|04419878|Yes|No]",,26/04/2024,30/06/2025,"CallOffFromDynamicPurchasingSystem ",,11:00

It is expected that the system will be used in protocols involving a demographically diverse participation cohort, and particularly with participants in the younger age ranges.
      
      In addition, the eye-tracking system will be used as a pedagogical tool for demonstrating the design and implementation of research methods using eye-tracking paradigms. 
      
      The University anticipates the requirement of two further non-invasive, precision eye tracking systems during the term of the Framework Agreement which may differ slightly to the current requirement's specification as described in Annex 2 - Specification.

Usage on this service has been higher than expected and as such, the DVLA is looking to procure a contract which will allow more deaf customers to contact us.

The current Video Relay Service is with DA Languages who provide us with Sign Solutions 'Interpreters Live!' service. Since it's launch in November 2023, the service has been very successful, reflected by the increased take up. A significant amount of work went in to implementing the Video Relay Service with DA Languages, including the technical set up of the incoming phone number, the advertising of this service on GOV.UK and through the Interpreters Live! app and web site and the creation of specific reporting. Additionally, all Contact Centre advisors and line managers were trained in the use of this service and are now comfortable with how it works. Retaining the current technology would mean we are able to provide continuity of service without having to redo all of the implementation and training work that has been put in, providing value for money for the DVLA.",,,Wales,"48000000 ","Kelly Gimblett",kelly.gimblett@dvla.gov.uk,"Longview Road,Clase",,SWANSEA,SA67JL,Wales,"01792 662190",,"RM6141-Framework-Schedule-6-Order-Form REDACTED.pdf ",,,24/04/2024,23/04/2025,23/04/2024,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,30000,,24/04/2024,30000,"[D A LANGUAGES LIMITED|D A Languages Ltd, Statham House,Talbot Road, Stretford
